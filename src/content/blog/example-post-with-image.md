This post demonstrates how to reference images from `public/assets/blog-images`.

Frontmatter hero image above is used on the list card and post header.

Inline image in markdown:

<!-- Example inline image (add your own file to public/assets/blog-images to use): -->
<!-- ![A diagram referenced from assets](/assets/blog-images/example-diagram.png) -->

If the files donâ€™t exist yet, add them to:

- public/assets/blog-images/example-hero.jpg

Commit and push; the build will include them automatically.
