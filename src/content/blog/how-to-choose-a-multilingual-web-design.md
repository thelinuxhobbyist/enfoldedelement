Designing for multiple languages can feel complicated, but a few principles go a long way:

- Choose fonts that support your target scripts (e.g., Latin, Arabic, Cyrillic).
- Allow flexible layout to support longer strings and different directions (LTR/RTL).
- Avoid text embedded in images â€” keep copy as real text.
- Test content with real translations, not placeholders.

A multilingual design respects cultural nuance and improves accessibility for everyone.
